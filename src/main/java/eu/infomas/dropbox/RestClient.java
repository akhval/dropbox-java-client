/**
 * {@code RestClient} defines the interface for a simple HTTP(S) REST client, used by
 * {@link Dropbox} and {@link Request}. 
 * It is <b>not</b> a general purpose REST Client!
 * <br/>
 * Functionality is very simple and "just enough" for getting {@link Dropbox} working. 
 * Actual implementations must extend this class and are discovered via the standard Java
 * {@link ServiceLoader service-provider loading} facility.
 * <br/>
 * Note that this type is part of the low-level API. In most uses cases you do not need 
 * this class (interfacing is done via {@link Dropbox} API).
